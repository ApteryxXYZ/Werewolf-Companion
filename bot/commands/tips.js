It does not really work the same way someone claims fool, but if the village starts lynching him you can shoot to find out if you suspect him of being the fool.

At the start of the game, if you do survive each night, jail the gunner until he uses his second bullet. After his second bullet, start jailing suspicious people. If the junior werewolf is confirmed, jail the junior werewolf and only kill it when it is the last werewolf. Remember to reveal yourself to the gunner so that he can vouch for you if you are getting lynched. If it is a cursed game, you can jail the cursed as well so that he will not become a werewolf, although there is a chance he is already a werewolf.
